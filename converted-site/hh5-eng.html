As my implemenetation of this is in progress, I use single points to reference complex locations: often these points are representative of a larger region or features. Pleiades calls the points I use in these cases the <b>representative point</b>. For a description of some of these different types of region, and how the representative point works, see <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/help/get-coordinates/?searchterm=%22representative%20point%22#:~:text=For%20each%20Pleiades%20place%20resource,with%20a%20distinctive%20orange%20circle." target="_blank">this page</a>.

		Full map of locations in Hymn 5 To Aphrodite:
		
		This map has all the locations in the hymn. The line should follow the path of the action, but some missing data means that this is still a work in progress. If you click on each popup, it will tell you the name of the location and where it appears in the hymn.

		<header><h1>Welcome to <em>Keryx</em>:</h1><br><h2>a multi-media text-encoding project.</h2></header>
		
		<p>This site contains texts of the (complete) long Homeric Hymns (2-5) accompanied by maps which show where the action moves throughout the hymns.</p>
		
		<br/><h2>Links to the hymns:</h2><br/>
		The following links are to the fastest versions of the hymns (see the bottom of the page for the work in-progress):<br/><br/>
		<a href="hh4-eng.html">Hymn 4 to Hermes</a>
		<a href="hh3-eng.html">Hymn 3 to Apollo</a>
		<a href="hh2-eng.html">Hymn 2 to Demeter</a>
		<a href="hh5-eng.html">Hymn 5 to Aphrodite</a>
		
		Instructions:
		This map was only tested on Google Chrome, although it should also work on Safari or Firefox. On Android, you can tap on the maps to reveal them. This feature does not work on iPhone: currently, I would recommend using a different device in that case. 
		
		Click on a text to see the English edition of the hymn. Each text is accompanied by maps one the right side which show the location(s) currently being visited in that segment of the hymn. Click on the marker or highlighted region for more information on that location. A complete map is provided at the end of the text.
		
		
		The following links are to the version of the hymns I am currently working on. Usually, both will be similar, but these will be much slower: there is not much reason to prefer them, but I make them accessible here.<br/>
		<a href="hh4-map-edition-eng.xml">Hymn 4 to Hermes</a>
		<a href="hh3-map-edition-eng.xml">Hymn 3 to Apollo</a>
		<a href="hh2-map-edition-eng.xml">Hymn 2 to Demeter</a>
		<a href="hh5-map-edition-eng.xml">Hymn 5 to Aphrodite</a>
